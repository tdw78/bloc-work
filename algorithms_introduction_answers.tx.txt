  1: UBER is impressive becaue their algorithm must, find the nearest driver to your pick up location, 
     find quickest path to destination and calculate price all in timely manner.
  
  2: Domono's Pizza is very efficient. Their algorithm receives your order, builds and cooks 
     your pizza accurately and quickly, then delivers your pizza to your address in a given amount of time
     to ensure your pizza is not cold by the time you receive it.
  
  3: Chipotle is able to accommodate a lot of customers in a relatively short period of time.  This is due
     to their efficient algorithm.  Each customer starts at the same point and is brought through the same 
     sequence of steps/decisions.  Each decision includes very few options, so the customer doesn't need to
     spend time thinking about their response.

3) An efficient algorithm will accomplish the goal in shorter amount of time without comprimising accuracy.
   To accomplish this, efficient algorithms will not have any unneccessary steps/directions.  Each step/direction 
   in the algorithm is relevant and is needed to achieve the desired result.  Also, each step/direction in the
   algorithm will be clear with what it is asking for and will not be able to be interpeted in multiple ways.
